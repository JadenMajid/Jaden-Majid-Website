                        After completing a set of five Python projects as part of the PHYS 210 course at UBC, which encompassed simulations of
                        air drag, RLC circuits, paramagnetism, gas particles, and solute concentration in liquids, I had the opportunity to
                        contribute further. I collaborated with the professor to restructure the course, involving the creation of learning
                        goals, project assignments, and grading rubrics.

                        As my involvement with the course progressed, I later assumed the role of a Teaching Assistant (TA). This role allowed
                        me to engage with students on a more direct level, guiding them through the intricacies of the course material and
                        offering assistance with their own projects.
